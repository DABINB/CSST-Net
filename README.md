# News üöÄ
- Dec 18, 2024: We release training code.


# Getting started
## Install
We test the code on Pytorch 2.2.1 + CUDA 11.8
1. Create a new conda environment, or take advantage of an existing conda environment.
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure python version 3.9 is available.

```
conda create -n CSSTNet python=3.9
conda activate CSSTNet
```
2. Install dependencies
```
conda install pytorch==2.2.1 torchvision==0.17.1 torchaudio==2.2.1 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Training and Evaluation
## Prepare dataset
You can download the datasets on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Km1Go4ilB_bI033SBJ7eJ0uCzbqEqbgt)„ÄÇ

Then arrange the data in the following formatÔºö
```
|-data
  |-data1.npy
  |-data2.npy
  |-data3.npy
  |-data4.npy
  |-data5.npy
```
Once you have downloaded the data set and settled it according to the above requirements, run the following statement to make the data you need for training and testing.



```
python dataset.py
```
> [!CAUTION]
> The current code can only be used to make noisy data, if you make noise-free data, please manually change the code.

After production, the predata folder will contain the following files:
```
|-predata
  |-data.npy
  |-label.npy
  |-data_0.npy
  |-label_0.npy
  |-data_2.npy
  |-label_2.npy
  |-data_6.npy
  |-label_6.npy
  |-data_10.npy
  |-label_10.npy
  |-data_-2.npy
  |-label_-2.npy
```

## Train
Once the data set is ready, training can be performed

```
python train.py
```

## Test
Please match the pre-trained weights with the dataset for testing, then:

```
python test.py
```
